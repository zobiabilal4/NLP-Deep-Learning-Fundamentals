    "## What is Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition is a part of Natural Language Processing. The primary objective of NER is to process structured and unstructured data and classify these named entities into predefined categories. Some common categories include name, location, company, time, monetary values, events, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, NER deals with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named entity recognition/detection – Identifying a word or series of words in a document.\n",
    "- Named entity classification – Classifying every detected entity into predefined categories.\n",

    "Manchester City (Organization) won the Premier League Trophy whereas in the following sentence the organization is used differently. Manchester City (Location) was a Textile and industrial Powerhouse.\n",

    "Your NER model needs training data to conduct accurate entity extraction and classification. If you are training your model on Shakespearean English, needless to say, it won’t be able to decipher Instagram\n",

    "The three most commonly used NER systems are the following:\n",
    "- Supervised machine learning :\n",
    "Supervised machine learning-based systems use ML models trained on texts humans have pre-labeled with named entity categories. Supervised machine learning approaches use algorithms such as conditional random fields and maximum entropy, two complex statistical language models. This method is effective for parsing semantic meanings and other complexities, though it requires large volumes of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rules-based systems :\n",
    "Rules-based systems use rules to extract information. Rules can include capitalizations or titles, such as \"Dr.\" This method requires a lot of human intervention to input, monitor and tweak the rules, and it might miss textual variations not included in its training annotations. It's thought that rules-based systems don't handle complexity as well as machine learning models.In this approach, information is extracted based on a set of pre-set rules. There are two primary sets of rules used,\n",
    "\n",
    "      -  Pattern-based rules – As the name suggests, a pattern-based rule follows a  morphological pattern or string of words used in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Context-based rules – Context-based rules depend on the meaning or the context of the word in the document.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Dictionary-based systems :\n",
    "Dictionary-based systems use a dictionary with an extensive vocabulary and synonym collection to cross-check and identify named entities. This method might have trouble classifying named entities with variations in spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning-based systems :\n",
    "In Machine learning-based systems, statistical modeling is used to detect entities. A feature-based representation of the text document is used in this approach. You can overcome several drawbacks of the first two approaches since the model can recognize entity types despite slight variations in their spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several emerging NER methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised machine learning systems use ML systems not already pre-trained on annotated text data. Unsupervised learning models are thought to be capable of processing more complex tasks than supervised systems.\n",
    "- Bootstrapping systems, also known as self-supervised, predictively categorize named entities based on grammatical characteristics, such as capitalization, parts-of-speech tags and other pre-trained categories. A human then fine-tunes the bootstrap system, labeling the system's predictions as correct or incorrect and adding the correct ones to a new training set.\n",
    "- Neural network systems build an NER model using neural networks, bidirectional architecture learning models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and encoding techniques. This approach minimizes human interaction.\n",
    "- Statistical systems use probabilistic models trained on textual patterns and relationships to predict named entities in new text data.\n",
    "- Semantic role labeling systems preprocesses an NER model with semantic learning techniques to teach it the context and relationships between categories.\n",
    "- Hybrid systems use aspects of multiple systems in a combined approach.\n"

    "# Named Entity Disambiguation (NED) and Named Entity Linking (NEL) and its applications\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have noticed over the years how search engines and social media recommender systems have gotten smarter and more accurate. Search engines are now capable of parsing ambiguous Natural Language queries, such as “Where do the Warriors play?” (i.e. Oracle Arena, San Francisco), and social media platforms are able to recommend posts which are related to comments you have written, or pages you have visited.\n",
    "\n",
    "The accuracy of these predictions looks fairly magical at times, but there's a lot under the hood to make it happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most interesting pieces of this puzzle is called Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), or Entity Linking (EL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Disambiguation is the task of mapping words of interest, such as names of persons, locations and companies, from an input text document to corresponding unique entities in a target Knowledge Base (KB). Words of interest are called Named Entities (NEs), mentions, or surface forms. The target KB depends on the application, but for generic Named Entity Disambiguation systems a common choice is Wikipedia. Usually Named Entity Disambiguation does not employ Wikipedia directly, but they exploit databases which contain structured versions of it, such as DBpedia or Wikidata.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we have a sentence like \"The Indiana Pacers and Miami Heat meet at Miami’s American Airlines Arena”, we can link each Named Entity to its Wikipedia page (e.g. en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pacers).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Disambiguation (NED), or Named Entity Linking, is a natural language processing (NLP) task which assigns a unique identity to entities mentioned in text. This can be helpful in text analysis. For example, a financial company may want to identify all companies mentioned within a news article, and subsequently investigate how the relations between the companies might affect the markets.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is helpful to view NED as a component within an information extraction pipeline given a text document. For example, if we were given a text document consisting of the sentence, “President Ford granted a pardon to President Nixon.”, we would first identify all the words of interests, such as ‘Ford’. This is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). The word ‘Ford’ can refer to President Gerald Ford, Henry Ford, or the car company “Ford”. As such, the second step in a pipeline is candidate selection, where we narrow down the list of possible candidates for the identified words of interest. Subsequently, we disambiguate entities from the candidate list and link each identified entity to a unique identifier within a knowledge base. In the example above, we should ideally identify the entity ‘Ford’ as ‘Gerald Ford’.\n",
