    "## What is Named Entity Recognition?\n",
    "\n",
    "Named Entity Recognition is a part of Natural Language Processing. The primary objective of NER is to process structured and unstructured data and classify these named entities into predefined categories. Some common categories include name, location, company, time, monetary values, events, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, NER deals with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Named entity recognition/detection – Identifying a word or series of words in a document.\n",
    "- Named entity classification – Classifying every detected entity into predefined categories.\n",

    "The three most commonly used NER systems are the following:\n",
    "- Supervised machine learning :\n",
    "Supervised machine learning-based systems use ML models trained on texts humans have pre-labeled with named entity categories. Supervised machine learning approaches use algorithms such as conditional random fields and maximum entropy, two complex statistical language models. This method is effective for parsing semantic meanings and other complexities, though it requires large volumes of training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rules-based systems :\n",
    "Rules-based systems use rules to extract information. Rules can include capitalizations or titles, such as \"Dr.\" This method requires a lot of human intervention to input, monitor and tweak the rules, and it might miss textual variations not included in its training annotations. It's thought that rules-based systems don't handle complexity as well as machine learning models.In this approach, information is extracted based on a set of pre-set rules. There are two primary sets of rules used,\n",
    "\n",
    "      -  Pattern-based rules – As the name suggests, a pattern-based rule follows a  morphological pattern or string of words used in the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "      - Context-based rules – Context-based rules depend on the meaning or the context of the word in the document.\n",
    "      \n",
    "- Dictionary-based systems :\n",
    "Dictionary-based systems use a dictionary with an extensive vocabulary and synonym collection to cross-check and identify named entities. This method might have trouble classifying named entities with variations in spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Machine learning-based systems :\n",
    "In Machine learning-based systems, statistical modeling is used to detect entities. A feature-based representation of the text document is used in this approach. You can overcome several drawbacks of the first two approaches since the model can recognize entity types despite slight variations in their spellings.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also several emerging NER methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised machine learning systems use ML systems not already pre-trained on annotated text data. Unsupervised learning models are thought to be capable of processing more complex tasks than supervised systems.\n",
    "- Bootstrapping systems, also known as self-supervised, predictively categorize named entities based on grammatical characteristics, such as capitalization, parts-of-speech tags and other pre-trained categories. A human then fine-tunes the bootstrap system, labeling the system's predictions as correct or incorrect and adding the correct ones to a new training set.\n",
    "- Neural network systems build an NER model using neural networks, bidirectional architecture learning models, such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, and encoding techniques. This approach minimizes human interaction.\n",
    "- Statistical systems use probabilistic models trained on textual patterns and relationships to predict named entities in new text data.\n",
    "- Semantic role labeling systems preprocesses an NER model with semantic learning techniques to teach it the context and relationships between categories.\n",
    "- Hybrid systems use aspects of multiple systems in a combined approach.\n"
