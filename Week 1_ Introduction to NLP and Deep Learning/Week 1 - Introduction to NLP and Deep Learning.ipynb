    "### some detailed explanation to dependency parsing and constituency parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Constituency Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "The constituency parse tree is based on the formalism of context-free grammars. In this type of tree, the sentence is divided into constituents, that is, sub-phrases that belong to a specific category in the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "In English, for example, the phrases “a dog”, “a computer on the table” and “the nice sunset” are all noun phrases, while “eat a pizza” and “go to the beach” are verb phrases.\n",
    "\n",
    "The grammar provides a specification of how to build valid sentences, using a set of rules. As an example, the rule VP - VNP means that we can form a verb phrase (VP) using a verb (V) and then a noun phrase (NP).\n",
    "\n",
    "While we can use these rules to generate valid sentences, we can also apply them the other way around, in order to extract the syntactical structure of a given sentence according to the grammar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s dive straight into an example of a constituency parse tree for the simple sentence, “I saw a fox”:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dependency Parsing\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to constituency parsing, dependency parsing doesn’t make use of phrasal constituents or sub-phrases. Instead, the syntax of the sentence is expressed in terms of dependencies between words — that is, directed, typed edges between words in a graph.\n",

    "\n",
    "More formally, a dependency parse tree is a graph G = (V, E) where the set of vertices V contains the words in the sentence, and each edge in E connects two words. The graph must satisfy three conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- There has to be a single root node with no incoming edges.\n",
    "- For each node v in V, there must be a path from the root R to v.\n",
    "- Each node except the root must have exactly 1 incoming edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, each edge in E has a type, which defines the grammatical relation that occurs between the two words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s see what the previous example looks like if we perform dependency parsing:\n",
